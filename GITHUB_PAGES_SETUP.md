# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup Guide

## ✅ Completed Automatically
The following configurations have been automatically applied to fix the deployment issues:

### 🔧 Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- ✅ Added base path: `/Akxtral-Study-grp/`
- ✅ Configured proper asset handling
- ✅ Implemented chunk splitting for better performance
- ✅ Optimized build settings for GitHub Pages

### 📦 Package Configuration (`package.json`)
- ✅ Added deployment scripts (`predeploy`, `deploy`)
- ✅ Installed `gh-pages` package for deployment support

### 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Automated build and deployment pipeline
- ✅ Proper permissions configuration
- ✅ Node.js 18 setup with npm caching

### 📄 Additional Files
- ✅ Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Updated `index.html` with proper title and favicon path

## 🎯 Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/FaraazHashmi07/Akxtral-Study-grp`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### Step 2: Trigger Deployment
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger when you push to the main branch. Since we just pushed the configuration, check:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Wait for it to complete (should take 2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Access Your Deployed Application
Once deployment completes, your application will be available at:
**https://faraazhashmi07.github.io/Akxtral-Study-grp/**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still see a white screen:
1. Check browser console for any remaining 404 errors
2. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### If assets fail to load:
1. Verify the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
2. Check that all asset paths in the built `dist/index.html` include `/Akxtral-Study-grp/`

## 🎉 Expected Result
After completing these steps, your StudyGroups application should:
- ✅ Load properly without white screen
- ✅ Display all existing features correctly
- ✅ Show resource management system
- ✅ Display community role visual differentiation
- ✅ Work with Firebase authentication and data
- ✅ Automatically deploy on future pushes to main branch

## 📝 Alternative Manual Deployment
If you prefer manual deployment, you can also run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This will build and deploy directly to the `gh-pages` branch.
